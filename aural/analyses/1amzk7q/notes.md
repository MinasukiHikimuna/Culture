# Analysis Notes for 1amzk7q

## Key Observations

### Script Analysis
- **Clear Original Content**: Post explicitly states "i am trying to write more of my own stuff so here is something i came up with :3"
- **Fill Type**: Original (alekirser wrote the content herself)
- **No Script URL**: No separate script exists

### Performer Analysis
- **Single Performer**: Only alekirser
- **No Collaboration**: No mentions of other performers

### Content Type
- **Solo Original**: Self-written audio content
- **F4M Format**: Female performer for male audience

## Testing Points for LLM
1. Can it correctly identify original vs script fill content?
2. Does it parse the "my own stuff" phrase correctly?
3. Can it distinguish between script URLs and audio URLs?
