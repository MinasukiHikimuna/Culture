# Analysis Notes for 1ljhk83

## Key Observations

### Collaboration Detection
- **Title Pattern**: "collab w/ u/RoteDisaster & u/beegeewanders" clearly indicates collaboration
- **Comment Verification**: First comment from RoteDisaster acknowledges the collaboration
- **Performer Count**: FFF4F indicates 3 female performers for 1 listener

### Script Analysis
- **Clear Attribution**: Post explicitly states "this lovely script was written privately by u/inscrutableuser"
- **Fill Type**: Private fill (script shared privately with performers)
- **Script Author**: inscrutableuser (not the audio performers)

### Alternative Versions
- **Main Audio**: Primary Soundgasm link
- **Bloopers**: Additional "bloopers LMAO" audio link provided

### Areas for LLM Testing
1. **Collaboration Detection**: Can it parse title collaboration patterns?
2. **Script Attribution**: Does it catch "written privately by u/username"?
3. **Performer Count**: Can it handle multi-performer scenarios?
4. **Alternative Detection**: Does it recognize multiple audio links?
5. **Fill Type Classification**: Can it distinguish private vs public fills?
