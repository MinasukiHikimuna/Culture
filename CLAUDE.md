- Culture Extractor is a scraper software.
- It scrapes both the metadata and the actual files.
- It utilizes primarily Python-based scrapy now.
- There are historical scrapers created with .NET-based Playwright.
- There might still be cases where we need Playwright but scrapy should be preferred unless Playwright is absolutely needed.
- The scraped metadata is stored into PostgreSQL database.
- The scraped files are stored on disk. Some of those might be moved elsewhere to Stashapp for persistent storage.
- During developing a new scraper, we can use MCP Playwright to interact with the site and inspect DOM.
- If a login page is encountered, let user handle the login.
- Prefer small commits i.e. first implementing just scraping a single list page and printing out the output, commit and then proceed.
- Use uv to run Python code.
